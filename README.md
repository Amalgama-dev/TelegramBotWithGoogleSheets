To get started, you need to create your Google project at https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python.
After creation, you need to add the downloaded file to the project folder and name it credentials.json.
In the main.p–Ω file, you need to insert the id of your google spreadsheet and the api of your telegram bot.
The work of the project is to record all the messages that the telegram bot receives in a Google spreadsheet.
